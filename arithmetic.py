'''POC for EXACT precision arithmetic that provides arbitrary precision OUTPUT.

A bit of Guido's time machine here: the decimal class provides Decimals that
act like people expect from school. This makes this implementation partly
piggy-backed on the Decimal class, but Numbers are stored with absolute
precision and given decimal place approximation are published on demand.

All of the arbitrary precision libraries I've seen, including Python's, allow
you to specify a given arbitrary but finite precision, and then work with
that precision. This method allows you to work with absolute precision for
any computable number you have the algorithm for (i.e. you can make a
generator that will yield any number of digits in a finite amount of time),
and then on-demand print a decimal approximation. Later on change your mind
and want an extra digit? No problem, just ask for one more digit. Same goes
for twice as many digits.

At present implementation of integers and decimals is obvious. But the
solution is generic to any computable number: override get_places with
something that will get the requested number of decimal places, and you have
an exact way to represent Ï€ or e as precisely as any algebraic number. You
need to furnish the algorithm, but you are able to furnish the algorithm
and work with any computable number you have the algorithm for.

This software is available to you under your choice of the GPLv2 or MIT
licenses.'''
